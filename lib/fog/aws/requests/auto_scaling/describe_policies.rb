        # Returns descriptions of what each policy does. This action supports
        # pagination. If the response includes a token, there are more records
        # available. To get the additional records, repeat the request with the
        # response token as the NextToken parameter.
        #
        # ==== Parameters
        # * options<~Hash>:
        #   * 'AutoScalingGroupName'<~String> - The name of the Auto Scaling
        #     group.
        #   * 'MaxRecords'<~Integer> - The maximum number of policies that will
        #     be described with each call.
        #   * 'NextToken'<~String> - The token returned by a previous call to
        #     indicate that there is more data available.
        #   * PolicyNames<~Array> - A list of policy names or policy ARNs to be
        #     described. If this list is omitted, all policy names are
        #     described. If an auto scaling group name is provided, the results
        #     are limited to that group.The list of requested policy names
        #     cannot contain more than 50 items. If unknown policy names are
        #     requested, they are ignored with no error.
        #
        # ==== Returns
        # * response<~Excon::Response>:
        #   * body<~Hash>:

        #     * 'DescribePoliciesResult'<~Hash>:
        #       * 'ScalingPolicies'<~Array>:
        #         * 'AdjustmentType'<~String> - Specifies whether the
        #           adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the
        #           current capacity.
        #         * 'Alarms'<~Array>:
        #           * 'AlarmARN'<~String> - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
        #             the alarm.
        #           * 'AlarmName'<~String> - The name of the alarm.
        #         * 'AutoScalingGroupName'<~String> - The name of the Auto
        #           Scaling group associated with this scaling policy.
        #         * 'Cooldown'<~Integer> - The amount of time, in seconds,
        #           after a scaling activity completes before any further
        #           trigger-related scaling activities can start.
        #         * 'PolicyARN'<~String> - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of

        #         additional results waiting to be returned. Pass this in to
        #         subsequent calls to return additional results.
