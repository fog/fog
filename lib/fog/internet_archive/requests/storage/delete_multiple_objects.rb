        # Delete multiple objects from S3

        #     maps from filename to an array of versions.
        #     The semantics are that for each (object_name, version) tuple, the
        #     caller must insert the object_name and an associated version (if
        #     desired), so for n versions, the object must be inserted n times.
        #
        # @param bucket_name [String] Name of bucket containing object to delete

        #       * Deleted [Hash]:

        #         * VersionId [String] - ID for the versioned onject in case of a versioned delete
        #         * DeleteMarker [Boolean] - Indicates if the request accessed a delete marker
