= HP Cloud Extensions to Ruby Fog Library

HP contributed to the native Ruby library Fog, through an HP Cloud developed extension to Fog via
the Object Storage, Compute and CDN providers. By using the HP Cloud Extensions to Fog, developers
can write applications using Ruby that interacts with the HP Cloud Services without having to deal
with the underlying REST API or JSON/XML document formats.

== Background

This library is an extension of Fog[https://github.com/fog/fog], a Ruby open-source cloud
computing library. The code in this library, contains all HP-specific support and is being
contributed back to the primary open-source library.

The HP Cloud Ruby library currently supports HP Cloud Object Storage, Compute, CDN, and
support for other services will be added as available.

== Installation

  sudo gem install fog

That's it! Try out the usage examples explained below to confirm your installation.

If you should ever need to remove the library:

  sudo gem uninstall fog

== Usage

The Ruby Fog library is well documented on the community web site at {fog.io}[http://fog.io], but for specific examples
using HP's extensions, see:
