    # @note Extracting XML components out of core is a work in progress.
    #
    # The {XML} module includes functionality that is common between APIs using
    # XML to send and receive data.
    #
    # The intent is to provide common code for provider APIs using XML but not
    # require it for those using JSON.
    #
    # @todo Add +require "fog/xml"+ and/or +include Fog::XML+ to providers using
    #   its services
