        # To delete objects from a single container, +container+ may be provided
        # and +object_names+ should be an Array of object names within the container.

        # To delete objects from multiple containers or delete containers,
        # +container+ should be +nil+ and all +object_names+ should be prefixed with a container name.
        #
        # Containers must be empty when deleted. +object_names+ are processed in the order given,
        # so objects within a container should be listed first to empty the container.

        # Up to 10,000 objects may be deleted in a single request.
        # The server will respond with +200 OK+ for all requests.
