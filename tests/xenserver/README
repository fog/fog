# Running the XenServer tests.

Tweak the helper.rb file in tests/xenserver/helper.rb to fit your needs.

Fog credentials in $HOME/.fog file are used to run the tests. In particular:

    :default:
      :xenserver_url: xenserver-test
      :xenserver_username: root
      :xenserver_password: secret

We need a working template named squeeze-test available in the XenServer
to perform the tests. Change the template name to fit your needs
or create a working template named squeeze-test.

The tests creates a few VMs during the flight. Make sure you have enough RAM and
Storage available in the hypervisor.

Run the XenServer provider tests issuing:

    shindo tests/xenserver
