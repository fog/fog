### 0.0.2 / 2014-04-10

Bug fixes:

* Add CHANGELOG.md to `fog-brightbox` module.
* Add MiniTest::Specs to project. Use `rake test` to check the code.
* Add Gemfile, Rakefile, README and LICENCE to start documenting project.
* Remove redundant calls to `Fog.credentials`. The code flow was such that the
  credentials were being passed in to `Fog::Compute::Brightbox` anyway.
* Isolate testing from contents of `~.fog` file which is leaking in throug the
  `Fog.credentials` global.

### 0.0.1 / 2014-02-19

Enhancements:

* Initial release of extracted `fog-brightbox` module. This is pretty much the
  pilot for fog modules so bear with us as we iron out the bugs.
