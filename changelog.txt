  Add SimpleCov and Coveralls.io dependenices     Add rake tasks for travis, which include publishing coverage reports. thanks mlincoln
  Change travis to use a rake task instead of shindont directly.     This is partly necessary for     https://github.com/lemurheavy/coveralls-ruby/pull/20, though     I'm a fan of running just "rake" or "rake travis" for simplicity     anyways. thanks mlincoln
  The actual simplecov/coveralls setup.     The use of Process.pid is an attempt to avoid confusing SimpleCov when     running tests in parallel.  Other tests frameworks take a similar     approach when they detect parallel_tests. thanks mlincoln
  Some cleanup based on comments on the PR. thanks mlincoln
